          <figcaption id="img-caption"> Eiichiro Oda, born January 1, 1975 in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan, is a professional mangaka, best known as the creator of the manga One Piece.
      
      A dedicated writer and artist since adolescence, Oda began working for Shueisha's Shonen Jump at 17 and currently stands as one of the world's most prominent mangaka, earning an estimated ¥3.1 billion (US$26 million) per year.[3] Despite his rigorous work schedule, he maintains steady correspondence with fans (and the wider public) through both formal interviews and informal channels such as his SBS columns.
